              With the double-move advantage, White can hypothetically move the
              light-squared bishop on b5 to e3 and their knight on g5 to h7.

            Every fifteen moves, the flow of the game shifts dramatically as one
            player is granted two consecutive moves; this leaves their opponent
            momentarily powerless without choice. The player who receives this
            advantage is decided at the beginning of the game, and both players
            are informed; the player with this advantage alternates. The same
            piece does not need to be moved on both moves.

              For example, in a drawn game with insufficient material, if Black
              last had the double-move advantage, White wins.

          <p>
            Stalemates and other forms of draws are a thing of the past (for
            Earthlings) since the game always concludes with a definitive
            result. If a game ends in a tie, the player last granted the
            double-move advantages loses. Now, there is no safe way out of a
            game—a drastic difference from any Earthly rules.

              With only a king in the position, White can promote to any piece.
            </figcaption>
          </figure>
          <p>
            The player promoting a pawn can only turn the pawn into a piece that
            has already been captured. As a result, a player cannot have two
            queens or more than two knights, bishops, or rooks on the board
            simultaneously. According to Tralfamadorians, when pieces are
            captured, they are not actually gone from the position; they exist
            in other positions. Or at least, so it goes.

              If White moved their knight from g1 to f3 on their previous move,
              they can return it to g1 and make another move.

          <p>
            Thrice per game, each player can undo their previous move without
            wasting their move. Again, the player brings back a previous
            position because the previous position has happened, is happening,
            and will always happen.

              The White knight on g1 can capture the Black pawn on e5 via f3.
              This would not have been possible if there was a piece on f3.

          <p>
            Once per game, each player can play what is known as a
            Tralfamadorian Capture. Players can capture any opponent piece that
            is two moves away; however, this ability is not possible if there is
            another enemy piece along its path.

            Enter the world of chess inspired by Tralfamadorians from Kurt

            You, a world-class chess grandmaster, step outside on a cloudy night
            to clear your mind before the upcoming World Chess Championship in a
            few days. Just then, the swoosh of a UFO tears through the silence,
            flying overhead like a giant ready to crush an unlucky bug. A
            cylindrical hatch opens and, with an irresistible force, drags you
            into the depths of this mysterious spacecraft.

          <p>
            Inside the flying saucer, you meet an assembly of bizarre beings,
            each with a slimy green hand crowning its shaft-like torso. In the
            palm of each hand is a single, piercing green eye, reminding you of
            a pointer you once bought at a school book fair.

            They introduce themselves as Tralfamadorians, and their way of life
            is as surreal as their appearance. They share their admiration for
            Charles Darwin and the game of chess. The Tralfamadorians have
            observed your dedication to the game, especially your preparations
            for the championship. To them, discovering Earthling chess was like
            a child receiving a puppy — a burst of joy.

          <p>
            Unfortunately, back on their planet Tralfamadore, they eventually
            found the game as monotonous as being stuck in a traffic jam. In
            search of excitement, they recreated the game's rules based on their
            unique perception of time and existence.
          </p>

          <p>
            Now, the game and its rules are timeless for them, quite literally.
            They explain that you were suddenly whisked away like an animal from
            an adoption center because they were curious to see how humans would
            enjoy their alterations.

            As they hand you a rulebook intentionally scribbled in childlike
            script—translating their language is as complex as translating
            English into dog barks—your curiosity about their origins and the
            peculiarities of their version of the ancient game deepen.
          </p>

          <p>
            Eventually, you are confident with your basic understanding of the
            game and, out of curiosity, ask them about the origin of these
            rules. But their artificial voices offer no explanation by saying,
            "It does not lend itself to warnings or explanations. It simply is"
            (Vonnegut 41).

          <p>
            Navigating this new chess world feels like deciphering an alien
            code, yet you cannot help but marvel at the game's uniqueness.
            According to the Tralfamadorian belief, death is not an end but
            rather a transition to another point in time. Or at least, "so it
            goes," they would say, stating a phrase that summarizes their
            peculiar existence.
